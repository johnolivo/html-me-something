        <header> How it all began...</header>
            <p>I started working at <span id="company">BCBSRI</span> about 6 months ago, I was in the accounting department, accounts payable to be specific.
                and they quickly saw that I had an eye for data manipulation and some decent excel skills. Fast forward a few months
                and I suddenly doing a bunch of different work with data. Manipulating databases and getting more heavily involved with
                our financials. I'm now a financial analyst. Doing more analysis regarding cost allocation than working with data and
                I'm not sure which I like more.</p>
